      <p>Hi, I’m Ellie Pitt, a 2:1 Digital Media Computing graduate from Birmingham City University with a passion for creative tech, design, and digital storytelling.</p>
      <p>I enjoy bringing ideas to life through engaging web design, clean code, and compelling video content. My work blends creativity and functionality, whether I’m building a responsive website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or crafting promotional videos using Adobe Premiere Pro and chroma keying.</p>
      <p>Throughout my degree, I worked on a range of projects, from a customisable restaurant website to a green-screen-based milkshake advert, and a recent drone promotion video. I also collaborated on a fictional company project promoting a water sensor for farmers, combining technical and design skills in a real-world context.</p>
      <p>I’m detail-oriented, creative, and always looking to improve my skills, especially in areas like colour theory, visual storytelling, and user experience design.</p>
      <p>I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute to exciting digital projects, grow as a designer and developer, and make an impact through thoughtful, user-focused work.</p>
      <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio or get in touch, I’d love to connect!</p>
